# Frontend Mentor - Multi-step form solution

This is my solution to the [Multi-step form challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/multistep-form-YVAnSdqQBJ). 

## The challenge

The challenge is to create a responsive Multi-step form consisting of 3 pages for entering/selecting information, 1 page for summary and 1 thank you page.
The users should be able to use the form efficiently from both mobile and desktop device. 

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made
